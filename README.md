# Area of mastery
Working with different Alpine.js, the different ways to handle data compared to React.js, the different elements that work with Alpine such as x-data, x-show, x-init, the event listeners for alpine.js such as @click and @change. The usage of $dispatch and $watch which we can use throughout the different elements and even JavaScript code that work with our HTML file.

# Project Process

# Challenges
The biggest challenge I had with this project, which I also could'nt solve in time for the submission was the ability to abstract my html components into seperate files where I even tried to use the library that my Coach had recommended, but I still couldn't get it to work.

# Feedback
This was a great introduction to a different JavaScript framework different from React.js . The project was diverse but thanks to the reference project and the knowledge of React.js and JavaScript, this was fun to work on.
